# Fitness Tracker Data Analysis

## Overview

In this project, I developed a model for classifying exercise types using fitness tracker data collected over a week. The goal was to create an accurate and reliable system for categorizing different types of exercises based on the collected data.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Pre-processing:**
  - Conducted comprehensive data pre-processing, including cleaning, merging, and resampling techniques. Ensured the data was ready for further analysis and model training.

- **Outlier Detection:**
  - Implemented various outlier detection methods, such as Interquartile Range (IQR), Local Outlier Factor, and Chauvenet’s criterion. This step aimed to identify and handle anomalies in the dataset.

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Utilized a variety of feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance. This included applying Butterworth’s low-pass filter, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Fourier Transformation to extract meaningful features from the data.

- **Feature Selection:**
  - Employed "Forward Selection" as a feature selection method to identify the most relevant features for model training. This step helped improve model efficiency and reduce dimensionality.

- **Model Training:**
  - Trained several machine learning models, including Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Identified Random Forest as the best-performing model with an impressive 98% accuracy. The model demonstrated its effectiveness in predicting exercise types, even on previously unseen data.

## Next Steps

This project serves as a foundation for further exploration and improvement. Potential future enhancements may include refining the model architecture, incorporating additional features, and exploring real-time predictions in a fitness tracking application.
